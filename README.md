   - Apply built-in methods for efficient data manipulation.
   - Declare and manage variables in JavaScript.

2. **Use Conditionals to Control the Flow:**
   - Employ conditional statements (if, else if, else) to control program flow.
   - Handle decision-making processes based on conditions.

3. **Construct Functions and Pass Data Through Them:**
   - Define functions to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
   - Understand how to pass data to functions as arguments.

   - Explore array methods for data manipulation.

6. **Use Loops to Execute Code Multiple Times:**
   - Implement loops (for, while, do-while) for repetitive tasks.
   - Control loop execution based on specified conditions.

7. **Use Iterator Methods to Simplify Looping:**
   - Employ iterator methods (forEach, map, filter) for concise array operations.
   - Enhance code readability and simplicity using iterators.

8. **Use JavaScript ES6 Object Syntax:**
   - Model real-world entities using ES6 object syntax.
